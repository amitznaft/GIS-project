# About the project
This task gradually opens up a complex system that enables the collection of geographic information, the production of insights from this information, and the presentation of information in graphical tools. 
It generates information about traffic loads in real time by accumulating waze information. We will look at an application such as many practices, and improve it.
the project consist Ex2 Ex3 Ex4 

# Ex2 
In this project we have developed an infrastructure for representing geographic information containing:
Geom:
A package of geometry that includes points, lines, paths, circles, squares.

Coords: 
A package that enables the conversion of coordinates from global coordinates to localis coordinates and return them

Gis:
Geographic - geometric information, divided into layers, including reference to time, place text, color

Algorithms:
General algorithms such as: selection within rectangle, selection of distance, moving, cloning, rithms deletion, conversion of coordinates,and a multicsv reader the scan folder for csv files and convert them to kml files  

File_formats:
A: a package that allows saving and restoring geographic information, text formatting, and _formats

# Ex3

In this phase, the geographic system continues to evolve, with some interesting twists.

A new Packman game was added to the mix, play the good old packman game over a real picture of a map.

the main target of exercise was to build and algorithm that will finish the game as soon as possible.

The game ends when all Fruits have been eaten by the packmen.

Finding the shortest path possible for a single player and a group of packmen has been build Achieving impressive results.

A Game can be built By several ways, including from a proper csv file, and manually from the Jframe (MyFrame) window.
