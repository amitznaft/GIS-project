# about all project
This task gradually opens up a complex system that enables the collection of geographic information, the production of insights from this information, and the presentation of information in graphical tools. 
It generates information about traffic loads in real time by accumulating waze information. We will look at an application such as many practices, and improve it.

#Ex2 
In this project we have developed an infrastructure for representing geographic information containing:
Geom:A package of geometry that includes points, lines, paths, circles, squares.
Coords: A package that enables the conversion of coordinates from global coordinates to localis coordinates and return them
Gis:Geographic - geometric information, divided into layers, including reference to time, place text, color
Algorithms:General algorithms such as: selection within rectangle, selection of distance, moving, cloning, rithms deletion, conversion of coordinates,and a multicsv reader the scan folder for csv files and convert them to kml files   
File_formats:A: a package that allows saving and restoring geographic information, text formatting, and _formats
